This project was focused on developing code to generate a written text using Markov chains with a‬
‭ given level of analysis‬‭ k‬‭ . The goal was to take in a source input and produce an output with‬
‭ similar character proportions by leveraging the probabilities of characters in the text. Through‬
‭ the implementation of this project, I explored how to handle file I/O, model, probabilistic‬
‭ modeling, and text generation. By the end of the lab, I successfully created a program that could‬
‭ mimic the style and character distribution of the source text.‬
